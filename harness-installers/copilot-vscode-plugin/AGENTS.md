# copilot-vscode-plugin/

## Purpose

A self-contained npm package (`@rad-orchestration/copilot-vscode-plugin-source`) whose `npm run build` produces the publishable Copilot in VS Code marketplace plugin. The source package is never published; `npm pack` runs against `output/` after build.

## How it works

`build-scripts/build.js` exports `runBuild(opts)` and is the single entry point. It executes steps in fixed order, fail-fast. The build reads adapter output for the `copilot-vscode` harness, bundles the CLI via `emit-cli-bundle` and ships the resulting `radorch.mjs` to `output/skills/rad-orchestration/scripts/radorch.mjs` (no separate pipeline bundle is emitted), bundles the UI, esbuild-bundles `bootstrap.mjs` with `lib/install/*` inlined, runs `expand-tokens` (destination-token substitution only — no agent namespacing for VS Code either), copies `plugin.json` to `output/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (Claude-format layout so VS Code injects `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` for hook self-location), synthesizes `output/package.json`, and runs structural validation.

`opts.rootDir` is the repo root. Three optional boolean flags — `opts.skipAdapterEngine`, `opts.skipUiRunner`, and `opts.skipBootstrap` — let tests bypass slow or environment-dependent steps when exercising the build orchestrator against a synthetic fixture tree.

## Source layout

- `build-scripts/` — `build.js`, `validate.js`, `synthesize-package-json.js`; see `build-scripts/AGENTS.md`
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin metadata in the Claude-format manifest location so VS Code detects this as a Claude-format plugin and injects `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` for hook self-location; its `version` field is the authoritative version for the published package
- `hooks/` — hook source; see `hooks/AGENTS.md`
- `lib/install/` — install state machine; see `lib/install/AGENTS.md`
- `manifests/` — per-version file manifests (`v*.json`)
- `tests/` — build orchestration and hook tests
- `output/` — gitignored build output; canonical npm-pack source

## Inputs this package reads but does not own

- `harness-adapters/output/copilot-vscode/` — compiled agents and skills produced by the adapter engine; agent filenames carry the `.agent.md` suffix for the VS Code harness
- `runtime-config/` — `orchestration.yml` and `templates/` staged under the build's `_install-source/`; bootstrap hydrates to `~/.radorch/` then removes the staging dir
- `cli/` and `ui/` at the repo root — `cli/` bundled via `emitCliBundle` to its canonical agent-visible location; `ui/` bundled via `emitUiBundle` to `_install-source/ui/` (bootstrap hydrates it to `~/.radorch/ui/` then removes the staging dir)
- `harness-installers/shared/build-helpers/` — shared `emitCliBundle`, `emitHookBundle`, `emitUiBundle`, `expandTokens` helpers

## Deltas vs the copilot-cli-plugin

| Dimension | copilot-cli-plugin | copilot-vscode-plugin |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Hook event names | camelCase (`userPromptSubmitted`, `sessionStart`) | **PascalCase** (`UserPromptSubmit`, `SessionStart`) — VS Code's native form |
| Hook dispatch layer | inline `node -e` shim in `hooks.json` reads `process.env.CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` (Claude Code injects it) | inline `node -e` shim in `hooks.json` reads `process.env.CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` (VS Code injects it when the manifest is at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — same mechanism the Claude plugin uses) |
| Bootstrap env var | `COPILOT_CLI_PLUGIN_ROOT` | `COPILOT_VSCODE_PLUGIN_ROOT` |
| Coexistence partners | two (`copilot-cli`, `copilot-vscode`) | three (`copilot-cli`, `copilot-vscode`, `copilot-cli-plugin`) |
| Model identifier shape | standard CLI-shaped | `(copilot)`-suffixed — the shape VS Code's model resolver requires; adapter-emitted upstream, not build-side |
| Install paths | single flat `~/.copilot/` path | OS-specific `agentPlugins/` paths; the runtime handles them automatically |
| Manifest layout | root `plugin.json` (Copilot format — works for Copilot CLI which injects `%COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT%`) | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (Claude format — Copilot format has no documented hook root-discovery mechanism in VS Code per the agent-plugins docs format-vs-token table) |
| Build step stderr prefix | `[build:copilot-cli-plugin]` | `[build:copilot-vscode-plugin]` |
| Token target | `${COPILOT_CLI_PLUGIN_ROOT}` | `${COPILOT_VSCODE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` |

## Why Claude-format manifest layout (and not Copilot format)

VS Code's agent-plugin docs gate plugin-root discovery on the **format declared by the manifest layout**, not on the plugin's runtime target. The format-vs-token table in `code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-plugins`:

| Format | Manifest path | Plugin-root token / env var |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (substituted in command/cwd/env fields AND injected as an env var on the hook process) |
| OpenPlugin | `.plugin/plugin.json` | `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` (same mechanism) |
| Copilot | `plugin.json` at root | **(Not defined)** — no token, no env var |

Hook commands need to know their own install location to dispatch into the right `bootstrap.mjs` / `drift-check.mjs`. With **Copilot format** (root `plugin.json`), VS Code provides nothing — no env var, no `${…}` substitution, no documented anchor. Empirically confirmed during the iteration that introduced this layout: the hook command was spawned with `process.cwd()` = the workspace folder, no plugin-root env var was injected (only OTEL/telemetry vars surfaced), and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` literals in the command string survived untouched into PowerShell on Windows, which then mis-parsed them. There is no documented mechanism in VS Code for a Copilot-format plugin's hook to self-locate. Microsoft's docs explicitly mark Copilot format's plugin-root entry as **(Not defined)**.

To get VS Code to inject `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` into the hook process, the plugin must be detected as Claude format — which requires `plugin.json` at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. That's what this installer ships. The hooks shim then reads `process.env.CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` and dynamic-imports the absolute file URL of the target `.mjs`, cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux).

The CLI-side sibling (`harness-installers/copilot-cli-plugin/`) keeps Copilot format because the Copilot CLI runtime **does** inject `%COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT%` per its own docs — the issue is specific to VS Code's hook dispatch for Copilot-format plugins. Each installer picks the format that gets it the discovery mechanism it needs for its target runtime; the two are independently packaged regardless.

## Why SKILL.md tokens are baked to absolute paths at install time

The token-swap pipeline this installer shares with its Claude and Copilot CLI siblings:

1. Adapter source skill content (`harness-files/skills/**/SKILL.md`) carries the generic token `${PLUGIN_ROOT}`.
2. `harness-adapters/` emits the same generic token unchanged (`bodyTokens: {}` for all three harness adapters).
3. The installer's `expand-tokens` build step swaps `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` to its per-harness variant — this installer produces `${COPILOT_VSCODE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, the Claude installer produces `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, the Copilot CLI installer produces `${COPILOT_CLI_PLUGIN_ROOT}`.
4. The token is meant to be substituted by the harness runtime in the agent's chat-shell at the moment a SKILL.md bash block is invoked.

Step 4 works for the Claude and Copilot CLI siblings because their runtimes populate the per-harness env var inside the agent's chat-shell. **VS Code doesn't.** The agent-plugins documentation's format-vs-token table covers env-var/token substitution only for *hook processes* (and only for Claude-format / OpenPlugin manifests). The agent's chat-shell — where bash blocks from `SKILL.md` actually execute — is a separate process with no plugin-root env var injected, regardless of manifest format. The literal `${COPILOT_VSCODE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` survives into the shell, where bash treats it as empty and PowerShell either treats it as empty or mis-parses it.

To close the gap, this installer adds an install-time bake step. `hooks/bootstrap.mjs` calls `bakeAbsolutePaths(pluginRoot)` from `lib/install/bake-paths.js` after `runInstall()` succeeds and before the `hooks.json` self-uninstall. It walks `skills/**/*.md` and substitutes the token literal for the real absolute install path (forward-slashed so the result is quote-safe in both bash and PowerShell on Windows). The bake scope is `skills/` only — `hooks/bootstrap.mjs`, `hooks/drift-check.mjs`, and `hooks/AGENTS.md` reference the same token in their own env-var logic and prose and must not be substituted. The bake is idempotent: post-bake there are no token literals left, so subsequent runs no-op at the scan. Plugin upgrades naturally re-trigger the bake because the new tarball re-introduces the token via fresh `SKILL.md` files and the new `hooks.json` re-introduces `UserPromptSubmit`, restoring the cycle.

The Claude and Copilot CLI sibling installers don't need this and remain unchanged — they continue to rely on their runtimes' env-var injection. Encapsulation rule holds: this fix is local to `harness-installers/copilot-vscode-plugin/` (a new `lib/install/bake-paths.js` module + a wiring call in `hooks/bootstrap.mjs`); no imports or references cross between sibling installers.

## Why the plugin's namespace is the satellite folder basename, not the plugin.json `name`

Empirically verified May 2026 and undocumented in VS Code's agent-plugins reference: VS Code's agent-plugin loader derives the chat namespace (`/<namespace>:<skill-name>`) from the **basename of the catalog entry's `source.path`** — the folder the payload gets cloned into under `~/.vscode/agent-plugins/github.com/<org>/<repo>/<basename>/`. It does NOT read this installer's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` `name` field, and it does NOT use the catalog entry's `plugins[].name` (that's only the install identifier passed to `/plugin install <name>@<marketplace>`).

The gap is invisible in practice because every entry in `github/copilot-plugins` and `github/awesome-copilot` happens to keep `plugins[].name == basename(source.path)`. `rad-orc-marketplace` was the first observed catalog where the two diverged, and that's the only reason this surfaced.

This is a VS-Code-only quirk. Claude Code reads namespace from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` `name`, and Copilot CLI reads it from the top-level `plugin.json` `name` — both correctly resolve `/rad-orc:…` regardless of where the payload lives on disk.

**Implication for renames.** Every one of these has to move together; missing any one of them leaves a stale path or a duplicate entry in the VS Code Agent Plugins panel:

- Satellite payload folder (e.g., `rad-orc-marketplace/rad-orc-vscode/`)
- Catalog entry `plugins[].name` and `source.path` in `.github/plugin/marketplace.json`
- Canonical `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` `name` (this installer)
- Hook error-prefix strings in `hooks/hooks.json`
- Test fixtures across `tests/*.test.mjs` that build the synthetic plugin tree
- The rad-release sync mapping at `.claude/skills/rad-release/scripts/sync-satellite-and-tag.mjs` — its `PLUGINS[].dest` field determines where the next release writes the payload in the satellite

The canonical folder name `harness-installers/copilot-vscode-plugin/` is internal-only — build scripts and tests pin it, but it never reaches users. It intentionally diverges from the satellite folder name.

## VS Code caches plugin metadata in multiple layers — purge order for a clean reinstall

After a satellite rename or republish, expect duplicate entries in the Agent Plugins panel and/or `Plugin source '<old-path>' not found after cloning` errors at install time. Both symptoms mean stale catalog data is cached somewhere outside the cloned payload tree. The file-system cache alone isn't enough; the SQLite caches below have to be cleaned too.

**VS Code must be fully closed first** — open VS Code holds file locks on the cloned repos and an exclusive lock on the SQLite DB.

1. **Cloned marketplace tree** — `~/.vscode/agent-plugins/github.com/<org>/<repo>/` (delete recursively; VS Code re-clones on next open)
2. **Installed-plugin tracking** — `~/.vscode/agent-plugins/installed.json` (remove the stale entry or reset to `{"version":1,"installed":[]}`)
3. **VS Code global SQLite state** at `%APPDATA%/Code/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb`. The Copilot Chat extension caches catalog data under four keys outside the cloned tree, so a renamed catalog can survive a folder-cache wipe via these. Edit via Python's `sqlite3` module (the `sqlite3` CLI isn't on Windows by default):
   - `chat.plugins.lastFetchedPlugins.v2` — flat list of all marketplace plugins with full source descriptors; filter out entries whose `marketplace` matches the renamed catalog
   - `chat.plugins.marketplaces.githubCache.v1` — per-marketplace cached plugin list keyed by canonical ID; delete the entry for the renamed catalog so VS Code re-fetches
   - `chat.plugins.marketplaces.index.v1` — marketplace-to-local-path index; same deletion
   - `chat.plugins.lastUpdateCheck.v1` — fetch-throttle timestamp; delete to force a re-fetch on next open (otherwise VS Code will trust the cache)
4. Optional but worth doing if Copilot CLI is also installed on the machine — `~/.copilot/plugin-data/<plugin>/` (Copilot CLI runtime data; VS Code cross-discovers it)

After all four purges, reopen VS Code; the Agent Plugins panel re-fetches the marketplace from scratch and shows a single clean entry per plugin.

## Seams

- **Upstream**: `harness-adapters/` produces the agent and skill files this build copies. The `(copilot)`-suffixed model identifier shape is emitted there, not here — the build does not translate model identifiers.
- **Downstream**: `npm pack` against `output/` produces the tarball submitted to the Copilot in VS Code marketplace. The build is the sole writer of `output/`.

## Coding conventions

- `build.js` calls each step through the local `step(name, fn)` wrapper which times and labels every phase; all step failures throw with a prefixed message.
- Paths are always resolved via `path.resolve` / `path.join` from `rootDir`; no hardcoded absolute paths.
- `output/` is wiped clean at the start of every build; the output tree is never partially updated.

## Rules for making updates

- Step order is load-bearing: adapter output must exist before `copy-agents`/`copy-skills`; bundles must exist before `expand-tokens`; `validate` must run last.
- `validate.js`'s `REQUIRED_ARTIFACTS` list must stay in sync with what the build actually produces. Hook dispatch is the inline `node -e` shim in `hooks.json` — no separate launcher artifact is required.
- Adding a new step: place it in the correct position in `runBuild`, update the step-count comment, and update `validate.js` if a new required artifact is introduced.
- `synthesizePackageJson` hard-codes `name: '@rad-orchestration/copilot-vscode-plugin'`; changing the published package name requires updating it there.
- Tests in `tests/` cover build orchestration end-to-end; run them after any build-script change.
