# Getting Started

By the end of this guide you'll have the orchestration system installed locally and a working mental model of the operator loop: brainstorm a project, plan it, approve the plan, and execute it — with optional automation for hands-off runs.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js v18+**

## Install

```bash
npx rad-orchestration
```

## Per-Harness Entry Points

For per-harness install and launch entry points (Claude Code, Copilot VS Code, Copilot CLI), see [harnesses.md](harnesses.md). The rest of this guide is harness-agnostic.

## Recommended Workflow

    A["/rad-brainstorm"] --> B["/rad-plan"] --> C["/rad-execute"]
```

1. **Brainstorm first.** Run `/rad-brainstorm` to align on goals, decide whether the work warrants a project series, and pull in any extra context — other documents, images, related links — that the planners can use downstream.
2. **Plan the project.** Once goals are locked, run `/rad-plan <PROJECT-NAME>`. Skills you've already authored in your own repo are picked up by the Planner during this step — no extra configuration.
3. **Review the planning output before approving.** The planner produces `{NAME}-REQUIREMENTS.md`, the phase plans under `phases/`, and the per-task handoff files under `tasks/`. This is the moment to course-correct. See [project-structure.md](project-structure.md) for what each document is.
> Recommended: Use the UI make review more comfortable, but you can also review in your code editor if you prefer.  See [dashboard.md](dashboard.md) for how the dashboard surfaces planning output.
4. **Execute.** Run `/rad-execute <PROJECT-NAME>` for in-place execution, or `/rad-execute-parallel <PROJECT-NAME>` for an isolated worktree + branch (recommended when you want `main` untouched, or when you want multiple projects in flight simultaneously).

5. **Lean into automation.** Enabling `auto_commit` and `auto_pr` lets the pipeline run hands-off through commits and pull requests; see [configuration.md](configuration.md).
> Recommended: At the very least, use `auto_commit` to let the agent commit directly to your branch as it executes. This will enable the code-reviewer to more clearly review against the code diff for the given task.

## Approve & Execute

After the plan is presented, choose a gate mode — `ask`, `phase`, `task`, or `autonomous` — to control when the pipeline pauses for your input; see [pipeline.md](pipeline.md) for depth.

## Pro Tips!
### Monitoring UI
The Monitoring UI will really help a lot as you learn the system and your velocity starts to skyrocket -- especially if you're running multiple projects in parallel. It'll help you stay organized and sane, trust me. ;)

It is also great for validating your plans.  Much easier than reviewing files.

For more information: [dashboard.md](dashboard.md)

### Steer your Orchestrator
While the project is executing, feel to talk to the Orchestrator.  It won't bite or break your project run. :)  The Orchestrator can be steered and can help you make adjustments to the project run if needed.

### Resuming Projects 
If you need to pause a project run, or your computer crashes.  Do not worry!  Your project is tracked and will easily resume from any point in time.  Type `/rad-execute <PROJECT-NAME>` and your project will reliably resume exactly where it left off.  



## Brainstorming & Project Series

The brainstormer is optional but recommended. `/rad-plan` will accept planning context directly if you'd rather skip ahead, but a short brainstorming session usually pays for itself with better planning output.

When you do brainstorm, the agent produces a `{NAME}-BRAINSTORMING.md` document in your project folder. `/rad-plan` picks that file up automatically — it's the formal handoff into planning, and whatever you capture there is what the Planner reads when it authors `{NAME}-REQUIREMENTS.md`.

The brainstormer is also a BYO-context surface. It helps you build a doc that links to existing PRDs, design docs, RFCs, screenshots, or any other artifacts the planner should be aware of — so the planning agents start grounded in your reality, not a blank page.

For larger ideas, consider a **project series**: a numbered `{STEM}-N` sequence (for example `MY-FEATURE-1`, `MY-FEATURE-2`, `MY-FEATURE-3`) where each project declares an explicit *Receives From* / *Delivers To* relationship with its neighbors. Splitting into a series keeps individual projects smaller, planning sharp, and execution reviewable. The brainstormer helps you decide whether an idea is one project or a series, and if it's a series, what the boundaries between projects should be.
