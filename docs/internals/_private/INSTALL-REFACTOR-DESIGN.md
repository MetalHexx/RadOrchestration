# Install Refactor — Design Document

**Date:** 2026-05-13 (updated 2026-05-16)
**Status:** Design aligned. The adapter subsystem has its own companion: [INSTALL-REFACTOR-ADAPTERS](~/.radorch/projects/INSTALL-REFACTOR-ADAPTERS/INSTALL-REFACTOR-ADAPTERS-BRAINSTORMING.md). Execution runs as a project series, all staged under `greenfield/`: the adapter subsystem rebuilds first, the installer subsystem rebuilds next (same greenfield pattern), and a final cutover iteration deletes the old root folders and promotes `greenfield/*` to the repo root.

---

## Context

The current installer layout carries cruft from incremental decisions:

- `installer/src/` is misnamed — semantically a publish-time staging area, not source code.
- A dogfood loop sits on top of the build CLI with its own staging hopper at the repo root, paralleling the installer's real deploy code path instead of using it.
- A single `installer/` package serves both the user-facing npm flow and (via the bundled `radorch.mjs`'s `plugin-bootstrap` subcommand) the Claude plugin's SessionStart flow. The two flows share enough to look like one but diverge enough to fight each other.
- `cli/` carries an `install` command wired into the CLI but never invoked in any production install path — vestigial.
- Source content (`agents/`, `skills/`) sits loose at the repo root, mixed with generated artifacts (`.claude/`, `.github/`), build outputs, and packages.

This document captures the target architecture for the installer + bundler side. The adapter subsystem has its own companion at [INSTALL-REFACTOR-ADAPTERS](~/.radorch/projects/INSTALL-REFACTOR-ADAPTERS/INSTALL-REFACTOR-ADAPTERS-BRAINSTORMING.md), referenced wherever it touches the broader layout.

```

The new structure stages under `greenfield/` across multiple project iterations while old folders at the repo root stay frozen and keep shipping. Cutover — deleting old folders and moving `greenfield/*` to root — is its own iteration, executed only after every greenfield subsystem (adapters + installers) is feature-complete and validated. Staging mechanics for the adapter side are in [INSTALL-REFACTOR-ADAPTERS](~/.radorch/projects/INSTALL-REFACTOR-ADAPTERS/INSTALL-REFACTOR-ADAPTERS-BRAINSTORMING.md).

## Adapter & engine subsystem

The translation subsystem under `harness-adapters/` has its own companion doc, [INSTALL-REFACTOR-ADAPTERS](~/.radorch/projects/INSTALL-REFACTOR-ADAPTERS/INSTALL-REFACTOR-ADAPTERS-BRAINSTORMING.md), covering its design and motivation in full. Headlines:

- **Adapter is a pure translation layer.** The engine is harness-blind; adapters declare per-harness rules (filename templates, body-token replacements) as small modules.
- **Per-harness frontmatter is hand-authored.** Each agent has one yml per harness alongside its body file in `harness-files/agents/`. No projection logic, no neutral schema, no tool/model dictionaries in adapters.
- **Body files use a `{{FRONTMATTER}}` token.** The engine substitutes it with the matching per-harness yml at translation time.
- **Skills keep frontmatter inline** (lowest-common-denominator authored across harnesses).
- **Engine output is just translated files** — no manifest at this layer. Each installer-bundler produces its own install-shape manifest downstream.
- **Destination-shaped body tokens pass through the adapter unchanged.** References to install destinations in body text (today: `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` in three UI skills; latent: hardcoded `.claude/skills/...` references in the planning skills) are resolved by the installer-bundler, not the adapter. The adapter handles harness vocabulary; the installer handles destination.

---

## Per-folder responsibilities

### `/harness-files/`
Source of truth for multi-harness content. Hand-authored agents and skills. Every adapter reads from here.

- `harness-files/agents/<name>.md` — body only, with `{{FRONTMATTER}}` token at top
- `harness-files/agents/<name>.<harness>.yml` — per-harness frontmatter (one yml per agent per harness)
- `harness-files/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` — full file with inline frontmatter
- `harness-files/skills/<skill>/...` — subfolders (scripts, references, templates) copied verbatim
- `harness-files/AGENTS.md` — module-level orientation for contributors

UI and CLI stay at the repo root rather than under `harness-files/` because both are self-contained npm packages with their own build systems and deploy to non-harness destinations. Hooks (`hooks.json`) live under the claude-plugin installer because hooks are plugin-specific.

### `/harness-adapters/`
Translation subsystem. See [INSTALL-REFACTOR-ADAPTERS](~/.radorch/projects/INSTALL-REFACTOR-ADAPTERS/INSTALL-REFACTOR-ADAPTERS-BRAINSTORMING.md).

### `/cli/`
Source of `radorch.mjs` — the runtime utility belt that ships inside the `rad-orchestration` skill.

radorch is a pure runtime utility belt: `doctor`, `where`, `harness use/list`, `ui start/stop/status`, `gate approve plan/final`. It should **not** contain:
- An `install` subcommand — install logic belongs to installers, not the runtime CLI.
- A `plugin-bootstrap` subcommand — the claude-plugin installer's entry point handles SessionStart bootstrapping directly.
- `cli/src/lib/upgrade/*` — upgrade logic lives inside the claude-plugin installer (`installers/claude-plugin/lib/install/`), its only real consumer.

### `/ui/`
Next.js dashboard. Lives at repo root: a self-contained npm package, deployed to `~/.radorch/ui/` (not into a harness folder), shared across all installers. Both installers consume it via the same `emit-ui-bundle` helper.

### `/installers/`
Top-level monorepo of installer variants and shared installer helpers.

- **`shared/build-helpers/`** — small helpers like `emit-cli-bundle.js`, `emit-ui-bundle.js`. Adapter knowledge is **not** here; it lives in `harness-adapters/`. Installers consume the adapter engine's output tree as input.
- **`standard/`** — user-facing legacy installer. One npm tarball ships all three harnesses; the wizard selects which to deploy. Mutually-exclusive Copilot harness selection. Owns `lib/install/` for its install state machine, including `base-files.js` for `config.yml`/`registry.yml`/`.harness` skeleton.
- **`claude-plugin/`** — UserPromptSubmit-triggered headless installer. Ships only the claude variant. Adds plugin-specific concerns: `install-log` (jsonl), atomic `install.json` + `hooks.json` writes, sentinel-driven self-heal. Earlier design iterations included `hash-check` (file-level drift detection) and `bootstrap-lock` (concurrency lock); both were dropped during INSTALL-REFACTOR-CLAUDE-PLUGIN iteration 1 scrutiny (see that brainstorm's scrutiny section for rationale).
- **`copilot-cli-plugin/`** and **`copilot-vscode-plugin/`** — placeholders for future plugin-style installers.

Each installer is a separately publishable npm package with its own `package.json`, version cadence, and tarball.

## Key flow walkthroughs

### Standard installer install flow (end-user)

1. User runs `npx rad-orchestration` (or `npx ./<tarball>`).
2. `installers/standard/index.js` runs the wizard (or `--yes` headless mode) and collects harness selection.
3. The bundled tarball contains `installers/standard/dist/<harness>/` with translated agents/skills (sourced from `harness-adapters/output/<harness>/` at pack time), the bundled `radorch.mjs`, the built UI, and the manifest catalog.
4. `installers/standard/lib/install/install-harness.js` reads `~/.radorch/install.json` to detect prior install version.
5. On upgrade: loads prior version's manifest from `dist/<harness>/manifests/v<prior>.json`, calls `removeManifestFiles` to clean up old files at their templated destinations.
6. Loads current version's manifest, calls `installManifestFiles` to copy from `dist/<harness>/` to `~/.claude/` or `~/.copilot/` (and `~/.radorch/` for shared assets).
7. Writes skeleton config files via `base-files.js`.
8. Stamps `~/.radorch/install.json`.

### Claude plugin install flow (UserPromptSubmit hook)

Updated by INSTALL-REFACTOR-CLAUDE-PLUGIN (iteration 1) — see that brainstorm for full design.

1. User installs the Claude plugin via marketplace. Claude Code copies the plugin payload to `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/rad-orchestration/<version>/`.
2. User submits their first prompt in any Claude Code session. Claude Code's `UserPromptSubmit` hook fires (the platform's only reliably-fired event after `/plugin install` or `/plugin update`).
3. The hook invokes `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/bootstrap.mjs` (the merged install orchestrator — replaces parent design's earlier `index.js` reference).
4. `bootstrap.mjs` reads delivering version from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/package.json`, compares against `~/.radorch/install.json`'s `claude-plugin` InstallKey entry; sentinel-checks for `radorch.mjs` on disk.
5. On version match + sentinel pass: no-op, self-uninstall the `UserPromptSubmit` entry from `hooks.json`, exit.
6. On version mismatch or fresh install: import stages from `installers/claude-plugin/lib/install/*` (bundled into `bootstrap.mjs` at build time so plugin cache doesn't need `node_modules/`) and run them in order:
   - Load prior version's manifest from bundled catalog
   - Remove prior version's files (skip entries with `ownership: 'user-config'` like `orchestration.yml`); prune emptied parent directories upward
   - `mkdir -p ~/.radorch/projects/`, `~/.radorch/logs/`
   - Copy runtime-config to `~/.radorch/orchestration.yml` and `~/.radorch/templates/`
   - Copy UI bundle to `~/.radorch/ui/`
   - Stamp `~/.radorch/install.json` atomically (tmp + rename) under `InstallKey = 'claude-plugin'`
   - Append a JSONL entry to `~/.radorch/logs/install.log` (6-action vocabulary, best-effort write)
   - On success, atomically rewrite `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/hooks.json` to remove the `UserPromptSubmit` entry (leave `SessionStart` intact). On failure, leave `hooks.json` untouched so next prompt retries.

   (Note: this is the new claude-plugin install flow. The legacy plugin install today also runs `writeBaseFiles` to populate `~/.radorch/config.yml`/`registry.yml`/`.harness`/`.gitignore` + `mkdir runtime/`. The new plugin installer drops all of these per INSTALL-REFACTOR-CLAUDE-PLUGIN — see that brainstorm for rationale. Cross-harness selection state moves to the standard installer's ownership in iteration 2.)
7. SessionStart's `drift-check.mjs` hook continues firing every session for cross-channel drift detection (plugin version vs `~/.radorch/install.json`); never self-uninstalls.

### Build flow (pack time, per installer)

1. The adapter engine runs first: `harness-files/` → `harness-adapters/output/<harness>/` (translated files).
2. `installers/<name>/build-scripts/build.js` runs:
   - Reads translated files from `harness-adapters/output/<harness>/`
   - `shared/build-helpers/emit-cli-bundle.js` bundles `/cli/` → `dist/<harness>/skills/rad-orchestration/scripts/radorch.mjs`
   - `shared/build-helpers/emit-ui-bundle.js` builds `/ui/` standalone → `dist/ui/`
   - Generates the per-installer manifest with sha256s and destination paths; writes to both `manifests/<harness>/v<current>.json` (committed) and `dist/<harness>/manifests/v<current>.json`
   - Copies all prior `manifests/<harness>/v*.json` into `dist/<harness>/manifests/` so the tarball contains the full release-history catalog
3. `npm pack` reads `installers/<name>/dist/` and produces the tarball.

Same pattern for `installers/claude-plugin/build-scripts/build.js`, except the manifest catalog is a single stream (no harness subfolder) and the plugin's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `hooks/hooks.json` get copied into `dist/` too.

### Dogfooding (developer inner loop)

No dedicated dogfood machinery. The inner loop runs the adapter engine and then the real install code path:

```
cd harness-adapters && node engine/build.js                       # populate harness-adapters/output/
cd installers/standard && node build-scripts/build.js             # build tarball staging
node installers/standard/index.js --yes --harness claude --bundle-root ./dist/
```

The adapter engine separates `harness-files/ → output/` (translation) from `output/ → installable tarball` (packaging), so each step runs independently for tight iteration.

---

## Decisions & rationale

### Decision 1: Source content lives under `/harness-files/`
- `harness-files/agents/` holds body files plus per-harness frontmatter ymls.
- `harness-files/skills/` holds skills with inline frontmatter (LCD authored).
- `/hooks/` lives under `installers/claude-plugin/hooks/` — it's plugin-specific.
- `/ui/` and `/cli/` stay at repo root — they're self-contained npm packages with their own build systems.
- Adapter-side details: [INSTALL-REFACTOR-ADAPTERS](~/.radorch/projects/INSTALL-REFACTOR-ADAPTERS/INSTALL-REFACTOR-ADAPTERS-BRAINSTORMING.md).
- **Rationale:** "harness-files" names the role: files that get harness-adapted. Keeping them in one folder separates source content from generated artifacts and packages.

### Decision 2: Adapter subsystem owns translation; installers own packaging
- `harness-adapters/` produces translated harness-shape files; `installers/<name>/` packages them into install shapes.
- The boundary between subsystems is `harness-adapters/output/`.
- **Rationale:** translation (per-harness content shape) and packaging (per-install-target shape) are distinct concerns. Separating them lets the adapter subsystem stay harness-blind and the installer subsystem stay install-shape-focused.

### Decision 3: radorch.mjs is a pure runtime utility belt
- No `install` subcommand. No `plugin-bootstrap`. No `cli/src/lib/upgrade/*`.
- Install logic lives in installers; upgrade logic lives in the claude-plugin installer.
- **Rationale:** install logic belongs to installers, not the runtime CLI.

### Decision 4: `/ui/` stays at root, not under `/harness-files/`
- **Rationale:** UI is consumed by both installers and deploys to `~/.radorch/ui/`. It's a self-contained npm package, not harness-translated content.

### Decision 5: Each installer owns its own install state machine
- `installers/standard/lib/install/` and `installers/claude-plugin/lib/install/` each contain a full state machine.
- **Rationale:** the two installers diverge meaningfully (claude-plugin needs the install log + atomic-write invariants + sentinel self-heal; standard needs config.yml skeleton writes + interactive wizard + harness selection). Independent copies preserve self-containment without coupling them through a shared library. (Earlier design iterations included `hash-check` and `bootstrap-lock` for claude-plugin; both dropped during iteration 1 scrutiny.)

### Decision 6: Manifest catalogs live inside each installer
- `installers/standard/manifests/<harness>/v*.json` (per-harness streams).
- `installers/claude-plugin/manifests/v*.json` (single stream).
- **Rationale:** each installer's upgrade catalog ships inside its own npm tarball so end users at any prior version have access to clean upgrade paths.

### Decision 7: Standard installer ships all three harnesses in one tarball
- The wizard selects which to deploy. Mutually-exclusive Copilot harness selection (vscode OR cli, not both).
- **Rationale:** smallest user surface (`npx rad-orchestration` works for everyone) versus three separate npm packages with lockstep versions.

### Decision 8: Shared build helpers stay narrow; adapters are not shared
- `installers/shared/build-helpers/` holds `emit-cli-bundle.js`, `emit-ui-bundle.js`.
- Adapter code is **not** here — it lives in `harness-adapters/`. Installers consume the engine's output tree.
- **Rationale:** clean boundary — translation belongs to `harness-adapters/`; packaging belongs to `installers/`.

### Decision 9: No dogfood machinery
- No `scripts/build.js`, no `dogfood-prior-<harness>.json`, no `/dist/staging/`.
- Dogfooding runs the adapter engine and then the installer locally with `--bundle-root` pointing at the freshly built `dist/`.
- **Rationale:** dogfooding is a local execution of the real code paths. A parallel deploy mechanism with its own state tracking adds complexity and naming friction without delivering value.

### Decision 10: Greenfield staging during rebuild
- The new structure lives under `greenfield/` until the rebuild is feature-complete.
- Old folders stay untouched during transition; `/agents/` and `/skills/` are frozen for the duration.
- At cutover, old folders get deleted and `greenfield/` contents move to root.
- **Rationale:** the old system keeps shipping while the new system grows in isolation. The freeze + cutover boundary keeps the working tree stable and the cutover clean.

### Decision 11: Destination-token substitution is an installer responsibility
- The adapter subsystem is install-destination-blind. It translates harness vocabulary (tool names, frontmatter shape, filename conventions) and passes destination-shaped tokens through the body unchanged.
- Installer-bundlers resolve any destination-shaped tokens in body text per their target layout — `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` (where the harness install root lives), and `${SKILLS_ROOT}` (path to skills inside an install). ADAPTERS' canonical tokenization pass converted literal `.claude/skills/...` references to `${SKILLS_ROOT}/...` in skill bodies and reference docs.
- Each installer knows its own destination: legacy npm installs at `~/.claude` / `~/.copilot`, the Claude plugin installs under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (a runtime env var), future installers do whatever they do.
- **A second build-time transform exists for the plugin installer specifically:** agent-namespacing rewrite (`@coder` → `@rad-orchestration:coder` in dispatch contexts) — required because plugin-installed skills are namespaced by Claude Code. This transform is Claude-plugin-specific; the standard installer doesn't run it because standalone-installed skills aren't namespaced. Both transforms run in the same build pass over body content.
- **Rationale:** the same Claude adapter output can serve both the legacy installer and the plugin installer because each runs its own destination pass. Mixing destination knowledge into the adapter would re-couple translation to packaging — the exact layering this rearchitecture exists to fix.

### Decision 12: `publish.yml` updates at cutover, not during iteration rebuilds
- During the greenfield iterations (claude-plugin in iteration 1, standard installer in iteration 2), `.github/workflows/publish.yml` stays unchanged. The legacy installer (`installer/`) and the legacy plugin build path (`cli/dist/marketplaces/claude/plugins/rad-orchestration/`) continue to publish from their current locations on git tag push.
- At cutover, `publish.yml` updates in lockstep with the folder deletion: the `publish` job's `working-directory` swaps to the new standard installer location, and the `publish-plugin` job swaps to publish from `installers/claude-plugin/output/` (or whichever location the new build emits to). Both swaps happen in the cutover commit alongside old-folder removal.
- Per-iteration dev loops are local-only: build locally (`npm run build` in the installer package), test via `claude --plugin-dir ./output` or a local marketplace install. No npm publish during iteration rebuilds.
- **Rationale:** keeps existing users on the legacy installer with no surprise upgrades during the rebuild. Cutover is the single atomic switchover from old paths to new paths — `publish.yml` is one of the files that participates in that switchover, alongside the folder deletion. Adding pre-release publish paths during iterations was considered and rejected as unnecessary CI complexity given that local-only testing covers the iteration dev loop.

### Decision 13: Marketplace catalog stays at repo root; plugin manifest lives in plugin payload
- The repo-root file `/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` is the **marketplace catalog** that Claude Code resolves when a user runs `/plugin marketplace add MetalHexx/RadOrchestration`. Per Anthropic docs, this location is load-bearing — the catalog MUST live at `<repo-root>/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. The rearchitecture does **not** move it.
- The file `installers/claude-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is the **plugin manifest** that ships inside the plugin payload (today at `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`; relocates to `installers/claude-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` in iteration 1). Build stamps the version into `output/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` per Anthropic docs' precedence rule (the plugin manifest's `version` always wins over a marketplace entry's `version`).
- **Two distinct manifests, two distinct locations, different roles.** The marketplace catalog points at the published npm package (`@rad-orchestration/claude-plugin`); the plugin manifest identifies the plugin from inside the cache copy.
- **Rationale:** the location of the marketplace catalog is an Anthropic-platform constraint; the location of the plugin manifest is convention. Earlier brainstorming risked conflating them, which would have broken the `/plugin marketplace add` flow.

### Decision 14: Build-time structural validation gates protect the published payload
- Every installer's `build-scripts/build.js` runs a final structural-validation pass before tarballing. Today's gates (from `scripts/build-plugin.js:123-177`'s `validatePluginTree`) carry forward into the new installer builds: required artifacts present, agent enumeration, namespaced-token rewrite verified in `orchestrator.md`, per-version manifest present, tarball size ≤ 50 MB × 1.1.
- Build failure aborts before npm publish; runtime detection of a broken plugin is a much worse user experience.
- **Rationale:** the build is the right time to catch structural breakage. Shipping an unvalidated plugin payload was a real bug class in earlier iterations and is now a documented gate.

## Migration scope

| Source | Destination | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/agents/` | `greenfield/harness-files/agents/` | Copy bodies; strip existing frontmatter; replace with `{{FRONTMATTER}}` token. Hand-author per-harness ymls alongside, using current `/adapters/<harness>/adapter.js` as the reference for each harness's expected frontmatter shape. |
| `/skills/` | `greenfield/harness-files/skills/` | Copy verbatim (frontmatter stays inline, LCD authored). |
| `/hooks/` | `installers/claude-plugin/hooks/` | Move; update build script (becomes `installers/claude-plugin/build-scripts/build.js`). |
| `/installer/` | `installers/standard/` | Rename; restructure subfolders per the target layout. |
| `/installer/src/` | `installers/standard/dist/` | Rename — currently misnamed as `src/`; gitignored except manifests. |
| Manifest catalogs in `/installer/src/<h>/manifests/` | `installers/standard/manifests/<h>/` | Pull out of `dist/`, commit to git separately. |
| `/plugin/` | `installers/claude-plugin/` | Rename; plugin manifest moves to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`; `bin/` payload dropped (vestigial). The plugin's SessionStart/UserPromptSubmit entry is the hook scripts under `hooks/`, not an `index.js` (the parent design's earlier `index.js` reference is superseded by Iteration 1's hook-as-entry decision; see INSTALL-REFACTOR-CLAUDE-PLUGIN brainstorm). |
| `/cli/src/commands/install.ts`, `install/skeleton.ts`, `install/harness-bundles.ts` | **Delete** | Vestigial install-shaped commands; absorbed into each installer's own state machine. |
| `/cli/src/commands/plugin-bootstrap/` | `installers/claude-plugin/hooks/bootstrap.mjs` + `installers/claude-plugin/lib/install/` | Subcommand absorbed; the hook script (renamed from `bootstrap-then-uninstall.mjs` to `bootstrap.mjs`) imports stages directly from `lib/install/` — no subprocess spawn. radorch loses this subcommand. |
| `/cli/src/lib/upgrade/` | `installers/claude-plugin/lib/install/` | Folds with plugin-bootstrap absorption. |
| `/adapters/` | Read-only reference during migration; deleted at cutover. The new adapter subsystem lives in `greenfield/harness-adapters/`. The existing adapter code is the source of truth for per-harness frontmatter shapes while authoring the new ymls. |
| `/scripts/build.js` and dogfood machinery | **Delete** | Per Decision 9. |
| `/scripts/build-plugin.js` | `installers/claude-plugin/build-scripts/build.js` | Move; gains shared helper imports. |
| `/scripts/build-*.test.js` | Distributed to each installer's `tests/` | Move with the scripts they cover. |
| Shared bundle/UI emit logic | `installers/shared/build-helpers/` | Extract from current `installer/scripts/sync-source.js` and `scripts/build-plugin.js`. |

References across the codebase update with every move — tests, CLAUDE.md, docs, build scripts, package.json `files` arrays.

## Non-goals

- **No dedicated dogfood architecture.** Inner-loop development uses the same code paths as end users (Decision 9).
- **No shared install-lib package.** Each installer keeps its own `lib/install/` (Decision 5).
- **No shared adapter library inside `installers/`.** Adapter knowledge lives in `harness-adapters/` (Decision 8).
- **No splitting `installers/standard/` into per-harness npm packages.** One tarball, wizard selects (Decision 7).
- **No top-level `dist/` at the repo root.** Each installer's `dist/` lives under its own folder; `cli/dist/` and `ui/.next/` stay where they are (package-local). `harness-adapters/output/` is gitignored too.
- **No changes to `radorch.mjs`'s naming or location post-deploy.** It still ships inside `<harness-root>/skills/rad-orchestration/scripts/radorch.mjs`.
- **No retroactive rewrite of past committed manifests.** The append-only catalog continues from wherever it lands at rearchitecture commit time.
- **`/cli/` does not move under `/harness-files/`.** Reason captured in Decision 4.

## Sequencing

The rearchitecture executes on a fresh branch, staged under `greenfield/`, after the in-flight installer-decouple PR merges. That PR contains the validated foundation (`destinationPath` routing-as-data, `installer/lib/install/` port, bridge deletion) that the rearchitecture builds on. The greenfield branch starts from main post-merge.

Old code at the repo root stays untouched during the rebuild — `/agents/`, `/skills/`, `/adapters/`, `/installer/`, `/plugin/` continue to ship while new code grows in isolation. At cutover (rebuild feature-complete), old folders get deleted and `greenfield/` contents move to root in one coherent commit.

An iteration plan that breaks the rebuild into concrete implementation steps will be authored separately.
