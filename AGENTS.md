# Repo Rules

These rules govern every contributor and every agent working in the orchestration system repo. They are absolute — read them before editing, building, or invoking anything.

## Canonical Source
- The [harness-files/skills](./harness-files/skills/) folder is canonical source.
- The [harness-files/agents](./harness-files/agents/) folder is canonical source.
- The [.claude](./.claude/) tree is runtime compiled for testing.
- The [.github](./.github/) tree is runtime compiled for testing.

## Never EXECUTE the pipeline from the Canonical source!
- When invoking the orchestration pipeline to execute a project, never read or invoke the files from the canonical source.
- Never read or invoke skills from the canonical source.
- Never read or invoke agents from the canonical source.
- The canonical source is uncompiled; running the pipeline from there bypasses the harness's resolved install root and produces incorrect path resolution for non-Claude harnesses.

## Only EDIT the Canonical Source!
- When making code changes to improve the Rad Orchestration system, only edit the canonical source!
- Editing files in the runtime compiled test trees is incorrect!

## DO NOT Add Requirements in Canonical Source
- When making changes to the rad orchestration pipeline and markdown files, do not leave requirements (FR-N, NFR-N, AD-N, DD-N) in the files. These should only be used in project planning documents, not actual code or documentation. The only exception is that we're making changes to the rad-create-plans or rad-code-review skills (under `harness-files/skills/`) which leverage requirements as part of project planning and code review.

## DO NOT Write Markdown-Shape Tests Without Explicit Instruction
- Do not author tests that assert on the textual shape of markdown files — regex `assert.match` / `expect().toContain` against headings, prose, pinned numbers in tables, or specific phrasing.
- These tests are brittle: every prose edit risks breaking them, and they pin the docs without testing code behavior.
- Broad anti-regression scans (one forbidden token swept across many `.md` files at once) are the exception; pinned-shape checks on individual docs are not.
- If a markdown invariant genuinely needs guarding, ask the user before adding the test.

## Codeblock Fences
When writing markdown documents in this repo, default to plain fences (no language tag) for shell commands. Most repo examples (`node`, `git`, `npm`, `gh`) are shell-agnostic — adding a `bash` or `powershell` tag primes agents on Windows toward the wrong shell. Only tag the fence when the snippet actually uses shell-specific syntax (`$env:VAR`, heredocs, `Test-Path`).

Do:
```
node example/build.js
```

Don't:
```bash
node example/build.js
```

## Per-module ownership
- Every module folder (`harness-files/`, `harness-adapters/`, `harness-dogfood/`, each `harness-installers/<variant>/`, `runtime-config/`, `cli/`, `ui/`) owns its own code, tests, and `AGENTS.md`.
- Cross-module reach-ins are forbidden. A module does not `require`, import, or read another module's internal files directly.
- Cross-module sharing happens only through documented seams — the canonical example is `harness-installers/shared/build-helpers/`, which every installer variant consumes as a published-seam package.
- Read the target module's `AGENTS.md` before touching it; it carries that module's local conventions, build commands, and seam contract.

## Reserved Namespace: rad-*

Skills shipped by the orchestration system carry the `rad-` prefix on both folder name and frontmatter `name`. The prefix is a **documentation-only reserved namespace** — the system does not hard-enforce uniqueness against downstream authors, but the planner-spawn manifest filter (the `radorch skill list` subcommand and its shared `buildSkillManifest` module) deliberately excludes any `rad-*` skill from the manifest. Authoring a `rad-something` skill in your own repo will therefore make it invisible to the planner.

See `.agents/skills/rad-create-skill/SKILL.md` for the matching authoring convention.

## Source Layout

Canonical agent and skill source lives under `harness-files/` (at `harness-files/agents/` and `harness-files/skills/`), authored in Claude shape — the format Claude Code reads natively. Nothing is generated *at the repo root* by the build — `npm run build` stages adapter output under `dist/staging/<harness>/` and then deploys it to the harness's user-level location (`~/.claude/` or `~/.copilot/`) via the same manifest-driven library every installer uses. Edit the canonical source; never edit the deployed output.

The rest of the repo splits by job:

- **`harness-adapters/`** — self-contained per-harness adapters (one folder per harness; see that folder's `AGENTS.md`).
- **`harness-dogfood/`** — the dogfood build CLI that drives adapters into `dist/staging/<harness>/` and deploys to the active user-level location.
- **`harness-installers/<variant>/`** — one installer per shippable variant (`standard`, `claude-plugin`, `copilot-cli-plugin`), plus a `shared/` seam consumed by all of them.
- **`runtime-config/`** — `orchestration.yml` and tier templates shipped verbatim by every installer into the user's `~/.radorch/`.
- **`cli/`, `ui/`, `docs/`, `prompt-tests/`, `.agents/`, `.githooks/`, `.github/`** — unchanged contributors to the system; see their own folders.

The `rad-*` reserved-namespace rule above applies to `harness-files/skills/` — it does not change with the restructure.

# Common Commands

## Multi-harness build (repo root)

After editing any file under `harness-files/`, run the build for the harness you're testing against. The build deploys to user-level (`~/.claude/` or `~/.copilot/`) — no repo-root dogfood folder is produced:

```
npm run build                  # Claude Code (default) → ~/.claude/
npm run build:claude           # explicit
npm run build:copilot-vscode   # → ~/.copilot/
npm run build:copilot-cli      # → ~/.copilot/
npm run build:all              # every adapter, sequentially (last one wins for shared user-level paths)
```

All of these resolve to `node harness-dogfood/build.js` with the appropriate harness flag.

**First clone of the repo requires `npm run build`** before the in-repo Claude Code instance can read up-to-date canonical content from `~/.claude/`. Note that `~/.claude/` is shared across all worktrees of this repo and across all Claude Code projects — only one branch's content can be the active dogfood at a time. Switch worktrees → re-run the build to swap.

**Be aware:** the system agents shipped from `harness-files/agents/` have bare names (no `rad-` prefix). If you have personal agents at `~/.claude/agents/` sharing those filenames, the build will overwrite them on deploy. The build's cleanup pass uses the prior dogfood manifest as the sole source of truth — no namespace globbing — so non-rad files outside the prior manifest are untouched.

## Tests by sub-package

This repo is a polyglot monorepo with several test runners. Pick the right one:

- **CLI bundle and pipeline engine** (`cli/`) — Vitest:
  ```
  cd cli && npm test                              # full suite
  cd cli && npx vitest run path/to/file.test.ts   # single file
  cd cli && npm run typecheck                     # tsc --noEmit
  cd cli && npx eslint .                          # lint
  ```
- **Adapters + dogfood build CLI** (`harness-adapters/`, `harness-dogfood/`) — Node's built-in test runner. Run from repo root:
  ```
  node --test harness-adapters/**/*.test.js
  node --test harness-dogfood/**/*.test.mjs
  ```
- **Installer** (`harness-installers/standard/`) — Node test runner:
  ```
  cd harness-installers/standard && npm test
  ```
  The marketplace plugin builders (`harness-installers/claude-plugin/` and `harness-installers/copilot-cli-plugin/`) each carry their own test suite runnable the same way: `cd harness-installers/<variant> && npm test`.
- **Dashboard UI** (`ui/`) — Node test runner via tsx, plus `next` for dev/build:
  ```
  cd ui && npm test
  cd ui && npm run dev               # dev server (port 3000 — kill any prior occupant first)
  cd ui && npm run build-and-start   # full production build + start
  ```

## Prompt harnesses

`prompt-tests/` is an operator-driven, on-demand regression harness for planner subagent outputs. It is **not** part of CI and costs real Opus tokens per run — re-run only when a planner prompt, skill workflow, or explosion-script change actually warrants a new baseline. See `prompt-tests/README.md` for the per-behavior runner protocol.

# Architecture

The repo ships a document-driven, multi-agent orchestration system plus everything needed to develop it across multiple AI coding harnesses.

## Three execution layers

1. **Agents and skills** (markdown) — the orchestration product itself. Twelve specialized agents (under `harness-files/agents/`) and ~18 reusable skills (under `harness-files/skills/`) communicate exclusively through structured markdown documents. There is no shared memory or message passing between agents — every interaction is mediated by a document on disk. Each document type has exactly one writer (sole-writer policy). The Coder reads only its self-contained Task Handoff.
2. **Pipeline runtime** (TypeScript) at `cli/src/lib/pipeline-engine/`, exposed to skills as the `radorch pipeline signal` subcommand — a deterministic state machine. The Orchestrator agent never makes routing decisions itself: it signals an event, parses the canonical envelope `{ ok, data, error }` from stdout, and dispatches on `data.action` against a fixed routing table. Routing, triage, and state validation are pure functions; LLM judgment is reserved for planning, coding, and review.
3. **Dashboard** (Next.js) at `ui/` — a read-only visualizer that watches each project's `state.json` and renders pipeline progress, documents, and configuration in real time.

## Multi-harness adapters

The system targets multiple AI coding harnesses (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot in VS Code, GitHub Copilot CLI) from a single canonical source.

- `harness-files/` is the **only** authored source — agents and skills written in Claude shape, which is also the format Claude Code reads natively.
- `harness-adapters/<harness>/adapter.js` is a self-contained per-harness projection: filename rule, frontmatter shape, tool-name dictionary, and model alias map. Adapters never transform the body of agents or skills, never modify `rad-*` skill names, and never ship settings or top-level instruction files.
- `harness-dogfood/build.js` discovers adapters, runs them into `dist/staging/<harness>/`, then deploys to user-level (`~/.claude/`, `~/.copilot/`) using the same manifest-driven library each installer uses — no repo-root dogfood is produced.
- Publish-time bundles that ship to end users are the deliverable of a follow-on iteration and are out of scope for this document.
- A new harness is added by mirroring the template adapter under `harness-adapters/` (an empty scaffold with its own README and tests).

## Pipeline runtime detail

The pipeline runtime is the load-bearing piece. It lives at `cli/src/lib/pipeline-engine/`
and is invoked by skills via `radorch pipeline signal`. The engine emits the canonical
envelope `{ ok, data, error }`; the orchestrator dispatches on `data.action`. The
action routing table at `harness-files/skills/rad-orchestration/references/action-event-reference.md`
(16 actions) is the contract; the schema at
`cli/src/lib/pipeline-engine/schemas/orchestration-state-v5.schema.json` validates
every write.

## Installer

The repo ships three installer variants, each living under `harness-installers/`:

- `harness-installers/standard/` — the `rad-orchestration` npm package end users `npx rad-orchestration` to install. It walks an interactive wizard, generates `orchestration.yml`, and optionally sets up the dashboard.
- `harness-installers/claude-plugin/` — Claude marketplace plugin builder; produces a plugin tree the user installs through Claude Code's `/plugin` flow.
- `harness-installers/copilot-cli-plugin/` — Copilot CLI marketplace plugin builder; produces a plugin tree the user installs through Copilot CLI's `/plugin` flow.

All three consume `harness-installers/shared/build-helpers/` as the cross-variant seam, and all three ship `runtime-config/orchestration.yml` and `runtime-config/templates/` verbatim into the user's `~/.radorch/`. None of the installers ships settings files or top-level instruction files — those are user-owned.

## Skill and agent loading

The canonical sources at `harness-files/agents/` and `harness-files/skills/` are **not** what Claude Code loads at runtime — Claude Code reads from `~/.claude/agents/` and `~/.claude/skills/` (user-level, shared across all projects and worktrees on your machine). `npm run build:claude` populates those paths by running the adapter into `dist/staging/claude/` and then calling the installer's `installManifestFiles` library to deploy. The same pattern applies to Copilot (`~/.copilot/`). After editing any agent or skill, run the appropriate build command before invoking it from the harness, otherwise the harness reads stale user-level content. When we edit project skills and agents, we are editing the canonical source at `harness-files/` — never edit the deployed output and expect those changes to survive a build.
