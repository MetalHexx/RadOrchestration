description: Drive the release flow locally — context, version reconcile, build, validate, CHANGELOG, commit, sync plugins to the marketplace, and tag/push (which triggers the CI npm publish + GitHub Release), then a post-release dev bump.
---

The local skill owns everything up to and including the `v{version}` tag push. The
main-repo tag push is the trigger for CI: `.github/workflows/publish.yml` builds and
publishes the standard installer (`rad-orc`) to npm and cuts the GitHub Release. The npm
credential lives in CI (the `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret), not on the operator's machine.

## Step 1 — Gather context

Run `node .claude/skills/rad-release/scripts/gather-context.mjs` from the repo root. This module reads the current version from `cli/package.json`, resolves the active branch via `git branch --show-current`, determines whether the working tree is dirty via `git status --porcelain`, and attempts to locate the most recent `v*` release tag via `git describe --tags --abbrev=0 --match "v*"` (returns `null` when no matching tag exists yet — expected on first release). Print the four-field result for operator awareness before proceeding.

## Step 2 — Up-front questions

Using the harness question tool (`AskUserQuestion` on Claude Code), present the operator with two decisions before any mutation occurs:

1. **Target version** — show the `currentVersion` gathered in step 1 and the `lastReleaseTag` (or "none yet" when `null`). Suggest the next version. **Release-in-place is the common case:** the previous release's post-release dev bump (step 10) already advanced the in-tree version, so if there is no `v{currentVersion}` tag yet, offer **releasing `currentVersion` as-is** as the default — this selects the no-re-bump path in step 3. Otherwise (the tree is at an already-released version), suggest the next pre-release counter (`-alpha.N` / `-beta.N`) or, if stable, a patch bump. Ask the operator to confirm or supply a different target.

2. **How the release commit reaches `main`** — **`main` is protected by a repository ruleset (`Require code owner review on default branch`) carrying a `pull_request` rule, so nobody can push to it directly.** The release commit therefore never lands on `main` by a direct push, and step 6 must never commit while standing on `main`.

   If `currentBranch` is `main`, say so and create `release/v{version}` before any mutation — the bump, the build, and the commit all happen there. If `currentBranch` is already a non-`main` branch, use it as the release branch. Then ask the operator how the branch should reach `main`:

   - **Agent opens and merges the PR** — the skill runs `gh pr create` and, once checks pass, `gh pr merge --squash`.
   - **Operator merges** — the skill pushes the branch, prints the PR URL, and stops before **steps 8 and 9** so the operator can review and merge, then resumes. The satellite sync must not run against an unmerged release branch: it publishes built payloads to the marketplace users install from, so syncing before the merge would ship a tree that might never land.

   Confirm the ruleset is still in force before choosing (`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets`) rather than assuming — if it has been removed, the direct-commit-on-`main` path is available again and worth offering.

This is an up-front question collected before any mutation, not a mid-flow approval gate. Two mid-flow approval gates follow: CHANGELOG approval in step 5 and post-release dev-bump confirmation in step 10.

Both answers are carried forward into subsequent gates.

## Step 3 — Lockstep version reconcile

If the confirmed target **equals** `currentVersion` (the release-in-place path from step 2), **skip the bump entirely** — every carrier already holds the target version, and the engine deliberately refuses a `from === to` no-op. Proceed straight to step 4.

Otherwise invoke `node .claude/skills/rad-release/scripts/bump-version.mjs --from <currentVersion> --to <new>` where `<currentVersion>` is the value gathered in step 1 and `<new>` is the target confirmed in step 2. Both flags are required — the engine fails fast if either is missing so the operator cannot accidentally bump from an assumed prior. This performs the lockstep bump across all carrier locations: wrapper `package.json` files (version field **and** any intra-repo `@rad-orchestration/*` dependency pin, kept in lockstep so `npm install` still resolves), plugin authoritative version sources, a hardcoded-literal sweep, and the two version fields in each nested per-workspace lockfile (`cli`, `ui`, `harness-adapters/engine`). The standard installer's per-version manifest catalog files (under `STANDARD_MANIFEST_DIRS`) are deliberately **not** touched by this step — its upgrade path requires every prior version's manifest to stay bundled so upgraders can resolve whatever version they're currently on, so those files accumulate rather than get renamed. The plugin variants are the opposite case: each keeps a single manifest, so the files under `PLUGIN_MANIFEST_DIRS` **are** renamed forward here, `v<from>.json` to `v<to>.json`, with the internal `version` field rewritten. For the standard channel the new version's manifest is emitted fresh by the build step (step 4) alongside every manifest already checked into the repo. A final re-grep halts loudly on any stray copy of the prior version left after the sweep — the guard excludes the graph-subsystem sandbox fixture (`prompt-tests/_handoff-sandbox/**`), incidental test/doc fixtures, and any historical manifest catalog file (which permanently and correctly retains its own version literal), none of which are release carriers.

## Step 4 — Build + validate

Invoke `node .claude/skills/rad-release/scripts/build-and-validate.mjs` from the repo root. This first runs `node harness-installers/standard/build-scripts/build.js`, the standard installer build, which builds the lib dependencies (repo-registry / work-graph / telemetry), translates the canonical `harness-files/` agents+skills for all three harnesses, packs the UI as `ui.tgz`, and emits `harness-installers/standard/output/` + manifests — the same artifact CI publishes to npm after the tag push in step 9. It then runs `node build-scripts/build.js` from each of the three plugin directories under `harness-installers/` (`harness-installers/claude-plugin`, `harness-installers/copilot-cli-plugin`, `harness-installers/copilot-vscode-plugin`), where each plugin's build script internally invokes the Gate 3 validator. A non-zero exit from any sub-step halts the flow immediately and prints the captured stderr to the operator.

After build-and-validate succeeds, invoke `node .claude/skills/rad-release/scripts/check-size-budget.mjs` to enforce the per-plugin tarball size budget (57,671,680 bytes = 50 MB + 10% headroom). Any plugin exceeding the budget halts the flow with a message naming the failing plugin and its measured size.

## Step 5 — CHANGELOG draft + approval gate

Run `node .claude/skills/rad-release/scripts/changelog-and-commit.mjs --draft --to <new>` to invoke `draftChangelog`. Pass the commit log since the last release tag (or the full history on first release) as the `commits` array. The draft produces a `## v{version} — {date}` heading with three subsections — `### What's New` (feat: commits), `### What's Fixed` (fix: commits), and `### Changes` (everything else).

Present the full drafted body to the operator using the harness question tool (`AskUserQuestion` on Claude Code). Frame the question with the full drafted CHANGELOG text inline so the operator can read it without switching context. Offer a single labelled option **Approve and commit**. If the operator wants to edit, they paste a revised body into the "Other / custom" field and resubmit — the revised text is used as `approvedChangelog` in step 6. This is the first of two mid-flow approval gates (the second is dev-bump confirmation in step 10).

The approved `## v{version}` block is also the **source of the GitHub Release notes**: CI slices exactly this block out of `CHANGELOG.md` after the tag push (step 9), so anything the operator wants users to read belongs here. First-release callouts are **not** auto-generated — the operator authors them by hand inside this gate when relevant (e.g. the `rad-orchestration → rad-orc` package rename, the `~/.radorc` storage standardization, plugins first appearing on the satellite).

## Step 6 — Single commit

Once the operator approves the CHANGELOG body, invoke `commitRelease` from `changelog-and-commit.mjs` with:

```js
await commitRelease({ repoRoot, version, approvedChangelog });
```

`commitRelease` prepends the approved entry above the previous most-recent `## v` block in `CHANGELOG.md`, then runs `git add -A` followed by exactly one `git commit -m "chore: bump version to v{version}"`. This single commit bundles every bumped carrier, every renamed manifest catalog (already `git mv`'d by step 3), the regenerated per-harness manifest files, the rewritten nested lockfiles, and the approved CHANGELOG body (atomicity). No second `git commit` invocation is permitted anywhere in the release flow between step 3 and step 7. (On the release-in-place path there is no bump, so this commit lands just the CHANGELOG entry.)

## Step 7 — Land the release branch on main via pull request

`main`'s `pull_request` ruleset means a squash-merge performed locally cannot be pushed. The release branch reaches `main` through a real PR, using the route the operator chose in step 2.

Push the branch and open the PR from the repo root:

```
git push -u origin <releaseBranch>
gh pr create --base main --head <releaseBranch> --title "chore: release v<version>" --body "<summary>"
```

Then, per the step 2 answer:

- **Agent opens and merges** — wait for required checks, then `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`. If a check fails, halt and surface it; never merge past a red check.
- **Operator merges** — print the PR URL and **stop**. Do not proceed to step 8 or 9. Resume only when the operator confirms the PR is merged.

Once the PR is merged, `git checkout main && git pull` so the tag in step 9 is applied to the squashed commit that actually landed. **Tagging the local release branch instead of the merged `main` commit produces a tag CI will build from a tree that never landed** — always re-point to `main` first.

The code-owner rule means the release PR needs the code owner's approval like any other. A release driven by the code owner still requires the PR; GitHub forbids self-approval, and the ruleset's bypass covers only the `pull_request` path.

## Step 8 — Sync built plugin artifacts into satellite

Invoke `syncSatelliteAndTag` from `node .claude/skills/rad-release/scripts/sync-satellite-and-tag.mjs` with the operator-confirmed `satelliteRoot`. At skill start-time, if the sibling path `../rad-orc-marketplace` is not a git checkout, prompt the operator via the harness question tool for the absolute path to their local satellite clone. This satellite is public and single-tenant by design, so there is no remote guard and no co-tenant filtering: the module replaces all three payload directories (`claude-plugin`, `copilot-cli-plugin`, `rad-orc-vscode`) wholesale from the freshly built `output/` trees, then rewrites every entry in both marketplace catalogs shape-aware. The Claude catalog (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) uses the nested `git-subdir` shape and gets `source.ref` pinned to the new `v{version}` tag (Claude Code honors install-time refs); the Copilot catalog (`.github/plugin/marketplace.json`) uses the flat / `pluginRoot` shape required for VS Code Copilot install-persistence and gets each entry's `version` field bumped to the bare new version — VS Code Copilot has no install-time tag-pin, so installs always pull the freshest payload from satellite `main` on its 24-hour update cycle, and the `version` field is surfaced in the Plugins UI for display only. Finally, it commits the satellite with `release: v{version}`. Any non-zero spawn exit halts the flow with the failing operation surfaced.

## Step 9 — Tag and push (triggers CI publish + Release)

The same module then tags both the main repo and the satellite repo with the matching `v{version}` and pushes `HEAD` plus the new tag from each repo to its `origin` using the operator's local git credentials.

**Pushing the main-repo `v{version}` tag triggers the `.github/workflows/publish.yml` CI workflow.** That workflow verifies the tag matches the standard installer's `package.json` version, runs a root `npm install`, builds the standard installer, runs its manifest-drift gate and test suite, publishes `rad-orc` to npm (`npm publish --access public --provenance`, authenticated via the `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret), and cuts a GitHub Release whose notes are the `## v{version}` block sliced out of the approved `CHANGELOG.md`. The standard-installer npm publish is therefore CI-owned; the operator's machine never holds the npm credential.

Roll-forward (a follow-up release) is the only recovery posture once tags have been pushed. (Prerequisite: the `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret must exist — a granular/automation npm token that can publish the `rad-orc` package. Until the package has ≥1 published version, npm trusted publishing / OIDC is unavailable, so the token path is required for the first release.)

## Step 10 — Post-release in-tree dev bump

After the tag and push gates complete in step 9, invoke `suggestNextDev(currentVersion)` where `currentVersion` is the version confirmed in step 2. This returns the next pre-release version — for example, `1.0.0-alpha.9` → `1.0.0-alpha.10`. Present this suggestion via the harness question tool (`AskUserQuestion` on Claude Code) with the option to accept the suggestion or supply a custom next-dev version. This is the second-and-final mid-flow approval gate (the first being CHANGELOG approval in step 5 — only those two pause points exist). On confirmation, invoke `runDevBump` with the confirmed `from` (the just-released version) and `to` (the suggested or custom next-dev version) to perform the post-release bump. This module invokes the same `bumpVersion` lockstep used at release-time (carriers, intra-repo pins, regenerated per-version manifests, and nested lockfiles), stages all changed files via `git add -A`, commits with the subject `chore: post-release dev bump to v{to}`, and pushes using the operator's local git credentials. On decline, the skill exits cleanly and the working tree remains at the just-released version.
