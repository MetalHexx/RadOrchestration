description: Drive the end-to-end release flow locally — context, version bump, build, validate, commit, publish, sync, tag, and post-release dev bump.
---

## Step 1 — Gather context

Run `node .claude/skills/rad-release/scripts/gather-context.mjs` from the repo root. This module reads the current version from `cli/package.json`, resolves the active branch via `git branch --show-current`, determines whether the working tree is dirty via `git status --porcelain`, and attempts to locate the most recent `v*` release tag via `git describe --tags --abbrev=0 --match "v*"` (returns `null` when no matching tag exists yet — expected on first release). Print the four-field result for operator awareness before proceeding.

## Step 2 — Up-front questions

Using the harness question tool (`AskUserQuestion` on Claude Code), present the operator with two decisions before any mutation occurs:

1. **Target version** — show the `currentVersion` gathered in step 1 and the `lastReleaseTag` (or "none yet" when `null`). Suggest the next version: if `currentVersion` is a pre-release (`-alpha.N` / `-beta.N`), suggest bumping the pre-release counter; if stable, suggest a patch bump. Ask the operator to confirm or supply a different target.

2. **Merge to main** — if `currentBranch` is not `main`, ask whether the operator wants to squash-merge to `main` after the release commit lands (step 8). This is an up-front question collected before any mutation, not a mid-flow approval gate. Two mid-flow approval gates follow: CHANGELOG approval in step 5 and post-release dev-bump confirmation in step 13.

Both answers are carried forward into subsequent gates.

## Step 3 — Lockstep version bump

Invoke `node .claude/skills/rad-release/scripts/bump-version.mjs --from <currentVersion> --to <new>` where `<currentVersion>` is the value gathered in step 1 and `<new>` is the target version confirmed in step 2. Both flags are required — the engine fails fast if either is missing so the operator cannot accidentally bump from an assumed prior. This performs the lockstep bump across all carrier locations: wrapper `package.json` files, plugin authoritative version sources, per-version manifest catalog file renames (with internal `version` field updated), and a hardcoded-literal sweep. A final re-grep halts loudly if any stray copy of the prior version remains after the sweep.

## Step 4 — Build + validate

Invoke `node .claude/skills/rad-release/scripts/build-and-validate.mjs` from the repo root. This first runs `node harness-dogfood/build.js --all`, which rebuilds the agents/skills output for all harnesses. It then runs `node build-scripts/build.js` from each of the three plugin directories (`claude-plugin`, `copilot-cli-plugin`, `copilot-vscode-plugin`), where each plugin's build script internally invokes the Gate 3 validator. A non-zero exit from any sub-step halts the flow immediately and prints the captured stderr to the operator.

After build-and-validate succeeds, invoke `node .claude/skills/rad-release/scripts/check-size-budget.mjs` to enforce the per-plugin tarball size budget (57,671,680 bytes = 50 MB + 10% headroom). Any plugin exceeding the budget halts the flow with a message naming the failing plugin and its measured size.

## Step 5 — CHANGELOG draft + approval gate

Run `node .claude/skills/rad-release/scripts/changelog-and-commit.mjs --draft --to <new>` to invoke `draftChangelog`. Pass the commit log since the last release tag (or the full history on first release) as the `commits` array. The draft produces a `## v{version} — {date}` heading with three subsections — `### What's New` (feat: commits), `### What's Fixed` (fix: commits), and `### Changes` (everything else).

Present the full drafted body to the operator using the harness question tool (`AskUserQuestion` on Claude Code). Frame the question with the full drafted CHANGELOG text inline so the operator can read it without switching context. Offer a single labelled option **Approve and commit**. If the operator wants to edit, they paste a revised body into the "Other / custom" field and resubmit — the revised text is used as `approvedChangelog` in step 6. This is the first of two mid-flow approval gates (the second is dev-bump confirmation in step 13).

First-release callouts (new `rad-orc` npm package, plugins first appearing on the satellite) are **not** auto-generated. The operator authors them by hand inside this gate when relevant.

## Step 6 — Single commit

Once the operator approves the CHANGELOG body, invoke `commitRelease` from `changelog-and-commit.mjs` with:

```js
await commitRelease({ repoRoot, version, approvedChangelog });
```

`commitRelease` prepends the approved entry above the previous most-recent `## v` block in `CHANGELOG.md`, then runs `git add -A` followed by exactly one `git commit -m "chore: bump version to v{version}"`. This single commit bundles every bumped carrier, every renamed manifest catalog (already `git mv`'d by step 3), the regenerated per-harness manifest files, and the approved CHANGELOG body (atomicity). No second `git commit` invocation is permitted anywhere in the release flow between step 3 and step 8.

## Step 7 — Reproducibility assertion

After the version-bump commit lands in step 6, invoke `node .claude/skills/rad-release/scripts/assert-reproducible.mjs` to gate the release on reproducibility. This module re-runs the complete build pipeline (per-harness dogfood builds + per-plugin builds + validation) and then invokes `git status --porcelain` to verify the working tree remains clean. If the tree is dirty after the second build pass, the gate halts immediately and names the dirty file paths so the operator can investigate the non-determinism. The operator must then restart the release flow against a clean tree.

## Step 8 — Squash-merge to main

Only executed when the operator answered **yes** to the merge-to-main question in step 2. Run the three commands below verbatim from the repo root (no separate module — inline shell invocation):

```sh
git checkout main
git merge --squash <releaseBranch>
git commit -m "chore: release v<version>"
```

Where `<releaseBranch>` is the branch name captured in step 1 and `<version>` is the target version confirmed in step 2. The squash collapses the entire release branch into one logical commit on `main`. If the operator answered no in step 2, skip this step entirely and proceed to step 9.

## Step 9 — Publish standard installer to npm

Invoke `node .claude/skills/rad-release/scripts/publish-npm.mjs` from the repo root. This module runs `npm publish --access public` from the local npm credentials held on the operator's machine. No `--provenance` flag is passed — the local-skill publish workflow accepts the loss of OIDC attestation and does not emit a signed provenance statement. The published package name is `rad-orc`, with the version taken from the lockstep bump produced in step 3 — for the first release, this is the alpha-N value carried forward from the current `cli/package.json`, not a fresh `0.0.1`. A non-zero exit halts the release and surfaces the npm error to the operator.

## Step 10 — Sync built plugin artifacts into satellite

Invoke `syncSatelliteAndTag` from `node .claude/skills/rad-release/scripts/sync-satellite-and-tag.mjs` with the operator-confirmed `satelliteRoot`. At skill start-time, if the sibling path `../rad-orc-plugins` is not a git checkout, prompt the operator via the harness question tool for the absolute path to their local satellite clone. The module replaces each of the three plugin payload directories (`claude-plugin`, `copilot-cli-plugin`, `copilot-vscode-plugin`) wholesale from the freshly built `output/` trees, rewrites both marketplace catalogs (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and `.github/plugin/marketplace.json`) so every `plugins[*].source.ref` points at the new `v{version}` tag, and commits the satellite with `release: v{version}`. Any non-zero spawn exit halts the flow with the failing operation surfaced.

## Step 11 — Tag and push

The same module then tags both the main repo and the satellite repo with the matching `v{version}` and pushes `HEAD` plus the new tag from each repo to its `origin` using the operator's local git credentials (no CI involvement). End-user installs of the plugins remain anonymous after this gate, and roll-forward (a follow-up release) is the only recovery posture once tags have been pushed.

## Step 12 — Generate workspace-local release notes

Invoke `node .claude/skills/rad-release/scripts/generate-release-notes.mjs` after the tag/push gate in step 11. This module writes `RELEASE-NOTES-v{version}.md` to the repo root with a four-section shape: `## What's New` (from whatsNew section), `## What's Fixed` (from whatsFixed section), `## Changes` (from changes section), and `## Package` (shipped artifacts table). Empty sections are omitted except `## Package`, which is always present. The file is intentionally outside `.gitignore` so the operator sees it in their working tree, but the skill never stages or commits it — the operator pastes its contents into the GitHub release UI for the matching tag and then deletes the local file locally.

## Step 13 — Post-release in-tree dev bump

After the tag and push gates complete in step 11, invoke `suggestNextDev(currentVersion)` where `currentVersion` is the version confirmed in step 2. This returns the next pre-release version — for example, `1.0.0-alpha.10` → `1.0.0-alpha.11`. Present this suggestion via the harness question tool (`AskUserQuestion` on Claude Code) with the option to accept the suggestion or supply a custom next-dev version. This is the second-and-final mid-flow approval gate (the first being CHANGELOG approval in step 5 — only those two pause points exist). On confirmation, invoke `runDevBump` with the confirmed `from` (the current version) and `to` (the suggested or custom next-dev version) to perform the post-release bump. This module invokes the same `bumpVersion` lockstep used at release-time, regenerates per-version manifests, stages all carrier files plus any regenerated `package-lock.json` files via `git add -A`, commits with the subject `chore: post-release dev bump to v{to}`, and pushes using the operator's local git credentials. On decline, the skill exits cleanly and the working tree remains at the just-released version.
