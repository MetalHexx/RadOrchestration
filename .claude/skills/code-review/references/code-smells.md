# Code Smells

The following categories are starting points, not an exhaustive checklist. Look beyond these — novel issues are often the most important ones.

| Category | What to look for | Illustrative example |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Documentation drift | Code behavior does not match documentation | README says the function returns a list, but code returns a single item |
| Null/undefined gaps | Missing null checks on data from external sources | API response field assumed to exist without validation |
| Defensive coding gaps | Missing error handling at system boundaries | No try/catch on file I/O or network calls |
| Silent failures | Errors caught but not surfaced or logged | Empty catch block swallows exception |
| Hardcoded values | Magic numbers, embedded paths, inline config | `timeout = 5000` with no named constant or config |
| Race conditions | Shared state accessed without synchronization | Concurrent file writes to the same path |
| Security boundaries | Unsanitized input, leaked secrets, missing auth | User input concatenated directly into a SQL query |
| Dead code | Unreachable branches, unused exports or imports | Exported function never imported anywhere |
| Implicit coupling | Hidden dependencies between modules | Module A directly reads a file owned by Module B |
| Resource leaks | Opened handles, streams, or connections never closed | File stream opened in function but no cleanup on error path |
| Scope creep | Changes touching files outside the Task Handoff's File Targets | Edit to an unrelated helper "while I was there" |
| Undocumented diff | Lines changed without a purpose tied to the task objective | Refactor of formatting or naming mixed into a functional change |
