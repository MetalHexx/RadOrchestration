/**
 * execute resolve — read-only run-mode classifier and advisor.
 *
 * Classifies where the operator is standing (main clone, worktree, side-project,
 * nowhere), resolves the target project, and emits a DATA envelope the thin
 * `/rad-execute` skill relays: the run mode, which questions are genuine forks,
 * the derived worktree convention, and the ordered `next` commands to run. It
 * never writes state and never invokes another command.
 *
 * Decision order:
 *   1. every repo a standard project targets must be registered AND bound to a
 *      local path — an unregistered repo cannot be recognized from any location,
 *      so this stop is checked before anything location-dependent.
 *   2. project TYPE — a side-project is isolated (`~/.radorc/side-projects/<name>`)
 *      with a fixed layout, and follows the same location-vs-started shape as any
 *      other project: in place when standing inside it, a launch into it otherwise.
 *   3. a recorded CLONE BINDING — a project bound to the operator's own clone has
 *      no workspace at all, so it resumes or launches into that clone (re-verified
 *      on every resumption) and none of the workspace logic applies.
 *   4. then, for a standard project, LOCATION vs SETTLED-NESS:
 *      - standing in the project's own worktree (the workspace folder itself, or a
 *        repo worktree beneath it) always runs in place — resume when settled (no
 *        prepare), an in-place confirm otherwise;
 *      - a SETTLED project named from anywhere else launches a fresh session into
 *        its recorded workspace folder, asking no recorded-answer question;
 *      - an UNSETTLED single-repo project named from inside that repo's clone, on a
 *        non-default branch, is offered a binding to the clone (a multi-repo project
 *        in the same spot stops — the model has to be explained, not worked around);
 *      - an UNSETTLED project named from anywhere else either launches fully
 *        questioned (no worktree at all) or offers to reuse a DIFFERENT project's
 *        worktree it is standing in (the follow-up / correction path).
