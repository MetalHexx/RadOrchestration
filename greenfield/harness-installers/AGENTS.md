# harness-installers/

## Purpose

Top-level container for every installer variant and the shared mechanical helpers that installer builds draw on. No code lives directly in this folder — it exists to group sibling packages with a shared discipline.

## Organization

- `claude-plugin/` — self-contained npm package that builds and publishes the Claude marketplace plugin. `build-scripts/build.js` is the entry point; `npm run build` drives the full 14-step pipeline.
- `copilot-cli-plugin/` — self-contained npm package that builds and publishes the Copilot CLI marketplace plugin. Architectural sibling of `claude-plugin/`; the deltas are documented in `copilot-cli-plugin/AGENTS.md` (no `.claude-plugin/` folder, `.agent.md` agent filename suffix, no agent-namespacing transform, marker-file idempotency, two coexistence partners). `npm run build` drives the build via the same shared helpers.
- `shared/build-helpers/` — five installer-blind helpers (`emitCliBundle`, `emitPipelineBundle`, `emitHookBundle`, `emitUiBundle`, `expandTokens`) shared by every installer build script. No installer-specific logic lives here.

The legacy `/installer/` folder at the repo root remains untouched; it is not part of this subtree and is not referenced by anything here.

## Inputs this layer consumes (but does not own)

- `greenfield/harness-adapters/output/claude/` — compiled agents and skills produced by the adapter engine
- `greenfield/runtime-config/` — `orchestration.yml` and `templates/` copied verbatim into each build output
- `cli/` and `ui/` at the repo root — bundled into the plugin output by `emitCliBundle` and `emitUiBundle`
- `greenfield/harness-files/skills/rad-orchestration/scripts/` — pipeline TypeScript source bundled by `emitPipelineBundle`

## Coding conventions

- Each installer variant is a standalone `npm` package with its own `package.json` and test suite.
- Build outputs land in a gitignored `output/` folder inside each installer package; nothing generated is committed.
- Cross-variant sharing happens only through `shared/build-helpers/`; no other cross-installer imports.

## Rules for making updates

- Adding a new installer variant: create a sibling folder, add `package.json`, consume `shared/build-helpers/` directly via relative path.
- Changing what `shared/build-helpers/` exports: update every installer build script that imports the changed function — all callers are local to this subtree.
- Never import from `shared/build-helpers/` at runtime (in hook code or install logic); these are build-time tools only.
